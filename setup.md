### Cloud VM Option
1. Create a free GCP account. 
    * Note on cost: If this is the first time you're creating this, you will have a bunch of free credits. If not, the VM below will cost you about 4-6 cents/hr.
2. Run the commands here in a gcp cloud shell: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackhoodieRE/ELF-Malware-Analysis-Seattle-2023/main/gcp-cloudshell-commands?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACDF56FDWO3IDN2PFH5QSL5EZDVM6CA
3. On the GCP console, go to the Compute Engine. There should be a new VM there.
4. SSH into it (click on ssh button-- google sets up ssh keys etc for free) and check startup script installation with `sudo journalctl -u google-startup-scripts.service`
5. Once the start up script is done, start and fix VNC server
    * Start a new server with `vncserver` and then kill it with `vncserver -kill :1`
    * `cp /tmp/xstartup .vnc/xstartup`
    * Then start a new vncserver with `vncserver -rfbport 3582 -geometry 1920x1080`
6. Isolate the VM
    * Create 2 egress rules --to deny outbound on all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    * Create an ingress allow rule to allow your VNC connection. Allow tcp on port 3582
7. Install a VNC client on your local machine and try connecting to the cloud VM.
8. Create a Machine Image (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-images/create-machine-images) of your VM. 


### Local VM Option
1. Download and install your favourite hypervisor. Virtualbox is free. 
2. Follow the instructions here to set up a standard remnux VM (won't run on Apple M1 or M2) https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance
3. Change network settings to 'host-only'/follow the method to isolate your VM based on the hypervisor you choose.
4. Download workshop files from here: LINK COMING UP
5. Take a snapshot and call it "clean".


Tip: if you have an ARM machine (M1/M2 Mac) local VMs are finicky. Hypervisor support isn't great either. That is why I am recommending a cloud VM. If you do get a working set up locally, I will ask you to share it :).
